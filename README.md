### Project goals and objectives

The primary objective of the SJSU Pantry Web application is to provide students in need of food assistance at San Jose State University with a convenient platform for receiving food aid. This is achieved by allowing them to use their own devices from any location to search the pantry's food inventory. It also aims to prevent long lines outside the pantry. It also enables students to obtain items based on their needs as opposed to by chance. SJSU pantry is an ecommerce type platform to figure out the availability of food in the pantry and book your order before you come. The project intends to develop a portal for students to place and track orders and a separate portal for administrators and volunteers to add and remove products, enable and disable categories, etc. It will help maintain a record of the utilization and history of the service.


### Problem and motivation
The Spartan Food Pantry is a food assistance program that provides non-perishable goods, fresh produce, and refrigerated items to qualifying students experiencing food insecurity. A significant number of SJSU students visit and utilize the university's pantry regularly. More than 18,880 SJSU students visited the pantry between March 2019 and January 2020, and roughly 24,000 students have visited since the pantry opened. Even during the "shelter in place" protocol that was implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been approximately 900 visits per week to the pantry. In the past year, 70,500 pounds of fresh produce were donated and managed by the SJSU Pantry. However, students are limited to one visit per week to the pantry, and the typical wait time in queues is 30 minutes owing to COVID-19 regulations. Consequently, they sometimes acquire food items based on chance rather than necessity.  It can become tedious for students to frequently visit the pantry to determine whether certain food items are available. In order to make the process of obtaining food from the pantry more convenient, we decided to build an application which helps the students, volunteers, and admins.
